Tensors - Just matrices that take contiguous locations in memory.
Unlike Python list elements that need not be stored together in memory. 

A tensor is a view on an underlying 1D storage. So we can have different shapes of the tensor mapped to the same storage. 
3 elements give us the tensor we seek from storage - 
Size, Offset, Stride - similar to numpy

PyTorch uses a trailing underscore to indicate that a function operates in place on a tensor (for example, Tensor.sqrt_)
